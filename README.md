# QGIS Python Cookbook

Another abortive book work-through? We shall see. This time it's the [QGIS
Python Programming Cookbook][QPPC], 2nd Edition (ISBN: 9-781-787-124-837).

[QPPC]: https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/qgis-python-programming-cookbook-second-edition

## Requirements

The book was written in 2017. At the time, the versions used were:

 - Python 2.7.x (based on a screenshot on page 21.)
 - QGIS 2.18.0 (stated on the back.)

However, as I work through this on Ubuntu 16.04 in 2020, I'll be using:

 - Python 3.8.2 (manually installed from an Ubuntu PPA)
 - QGIS 2.8.6 (from Ubuntu repository, don't ask me why it's earlier.)
   - the inbuilt QGIS Python Console uses Python 2.7.12
